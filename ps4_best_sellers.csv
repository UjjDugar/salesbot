It is playable with one to three players as a tactical co-op FPS and features some well-known and beloved operators from Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege.Formerly titled Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Quarantine, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction is being developed by a seasoned team of veterans at Ubisoft Montreal. Inspired by the long-standing brand legacy of co-op Rainbow Six shooters and the varied cast of operators found in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, they are creating a brand-new, deep, full-featured, one-for-all, tactical co-op experience.Three years ago, in the quaint town of Truth or Consequences, a meteor crashed down on a New Mexico community, releasing an unknown parasite. A handful of operators from Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege teamed up together and seemingly contained the mysterious parasite during the initial outbreak.Unexpectedly, the Chimera parasite has suddenly reappeared in multiple sites across the US, deadlier than ever and spreading rapidly. To monitor the parasite and prepare for any future threat, the Rainbow Exogenous Analysis & Containment Team (REACT), a highly specialized and outfitted organization led by Eliza “Ash” Cohen, Dr. Elena “Mira” Álvarez, and Jordan “Thermite” Trace, was created.Almost nothing is known about the evolving parasite, and REACT’s hand-selected operators are the only ones suited to engage, push back, and learn about this deadly new threat. It is your mission to confront the mysterious creatures, known as the Archæns, who are now more lethal than ever before. Deploying into containment zones with the right combination of gadgets, gear, and teamwork will be integral to gathering the intel needed to stop them. With each incursion, you’ll face the difficult choice of pushing deeper or extracting while hoping to save the operators in your squad from going MIA.Prepare to launch into thrilling, challenging, and often unpredictable missions as you and your squad risk everything together every time you step into the containment zone.LEAD ELITE RAINBOW SIX OPERATORS IN CO-OP OR SOLO PLAYNo longer divided into separate teams of attackers and defenders, you will lead your squad of up to three operators or go at it alone. Pick from 18 of the Rainbow Six operators that are best adapted to survive the incursions. Each operator has a specific set of weapons, gadgets, and abilities to learn and master, lending to highly replayable and immersive gameplay. The uniqueness and different playstyle of each operator allows for limitless options in customizing your roster; striking the right balance on your team will be the key to success.With each mission completed, your operator will level up, boost their stats, and gain access to new loadout options and powerful combat perks that are specifically designed to take on the parasite in its many different forms. Band together, create a well-rounded squad, and put your skills to the test inside the containment zones.RISK IT ALL IN UNPREDICTABLE CONTAINMENT ZONESSet in four regions across the US, containment zones are aggressively dominated by the parasite, creating an evolving and unstable ecosystem within their walls. Incursions into these hot zones will challenge your team every time. Knowledge, cooperation, and a tactical approach are your best weapons to survive. Use your gadgets and your operators’ ability to adapt and overcome the situation to successfully accomplish your objectives, and above all, extract from the containment zone. With a selection of 12 uniquely designed maps featuring procedurally generated challenges, enemies, infestation, and increasing difficulty, the dangers are unpredictable and constantly evolving. The deeper you go from airlock to airlock, the richer the rewards, but the greater the risks your squad will face, making it harder to reach your objectives.If an operator fails to get to an extraction point, you and your team will have a choice to make: push on further for bigger rewards, leaving your operator behind, or head back to mount a daring rescue. Those who don’t make it will find their operator MIA, making them temporarily unavailable for future missions. The only means of recovering an MIA operator is to mount a rescue in one of the submaps before the parasite takes them over completely. You risk everything every time you step into the containment zone.FIGHT A LETHAL AND EVOLVING ALIEN THREATThe Chimera parasite and its evolving Archæns are highly lethal sentient organisms – consuming resources and reshaping the landscape. As REACT hopes to learn from this unique but deadly phenomenon, you will have to count on your teammates and your own instincts to face each of the 10 parasitic archetypes, from the vicious Spiker to the elusive Tormentor and the summoning Apex. Survive the Sprawl, a flow of self-aware parasitic tissue that spreads over the containment zone, altering the ecosystem surrounding you and ultimately giving the advantage to its native Archæns. Areas that were previously infested with parasitic nests may be clear, while previously safe zones will be ravaged by the Sprawl and other deadly enemies. Work together to leverage the destruction technology from Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege to reinforce walls against attacks or tear them down to create offensive opportunities.CROSS-BENEFITSThe game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one. Play both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction to unlock the game’s entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, and players will get elite United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.** Requires playing both games with the same Ubisoft Account.
